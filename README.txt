April 18, 2020: Created this repo to capture the tutorial materials from the OATS talks
given at Ag Gateway Annual meeting in fall 2019 (New Orleans). I have pared this repo down
a bit because it was too large owing to the data files (CAN log files primarily), which
had been included. Once I figure out how to access the data, there will be a revision.
